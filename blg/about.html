If the eye was given permission to see, no creature would be able to withstand the abundance and ubiquity of the <span class="cr">daemons</span> and continue to live unaffected by them. <br>
They are more numerous than we are and they stand over us like mounds of earth surrounding a pit. <br>
Each and every one of us has a thousand demons to his left and ten thousand to his right.  <br>
<span class="cr">THE DAEMONVEIL</span> protects man from these daemons, <br>
As it says in the verse: "A thousand may fall at your side, and ten thousand at your right hand; they will not approach you"
