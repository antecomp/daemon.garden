TODO: Will contain all the contacts and their current statuses, with easy methods to target a certain person and change their status.
Also, similarly, will implement notes for different people that will be saved and updated throughout the game.
If the notes become too much data hit (unlikely) we can save the notes seperately and swap out the current note by ID or some shit.
