			<h3>Noema</h3> 
			<h4>Plural: Noemata</h4>
			<p>
				The word noema derives from the Greek word νόημα meaning "mental object". The philosopher Edmund Husserl used noema as a technical term in phenomenology to stand for the object or content of a thought, judgement, or perception, but its precise meaning in his work has remained a matter of controversy
