# DÆMONGARDEN

[dæmon.garden](https://daemon.garden/) ~is~ will be a game by [omnidisplay](https://omnipresence.neocities.org) and [moribund](https://rabbitpaths.neocities.org)

Dæmongarden at the moment is still extremely early in development, filled mainly with assorted tests, but it's nice to have a public GH to show our progress :)

Dæmongarden is made using ReactJS and built using Vite.
